### Credits
- NMID is a separate version/fork of the nexus-mod-image-downloader with additional functionality and an extra button for downloading images. We would like to thank lazytwinkletoes for their contribution.
- The NexusMods icon used in the extension was sourced from PngEgg.
- Lastly, to modify the original extension, I used ChatGPT as I am not a JS developer. 
This Readme also was written with the help of ChatGPT.
